# songs-about-cities

I feel European, but I am a local patriot when it comes to my city of birth (Cologne).    
That's why I was convinced that Cologne is the most sung-about city in Germany.    
I was astounded when I questioned this for the first time and searched for statistics about the most sung-about cities.    
According to an analysis made by Holidu in collaboration with Musixmatch the most sung-about cities in Germany are in descending order the following:    
 
| City       | Number of songs |
|------------|-----------------|
| Berlin     | 6.012           |
| Hamburg    | 1.226           |
| Frankfurt  | 876             |
| München    | 468             |
| Bonn       | 417             |
| Köln       | 373             |
| Düsseldorf | 308             |
| Stuttgart  | 279             |
| Kiel       | 275             |
| Dresden    | 253             |

According to this analysis, most songs are about Berlin. However, there are even more songs about Frankfurt, München and Bonn, than about Cologne.  
This result seems odd to me, especially since I live in Bonn and I know precisely one song about Bonn. This is a rap song that is more about a business in Bonn than about Bonn itself.   
I started this project to question the results presented by Holidu.

Within this project, I will analyze two german songtext platforms (musikguru.de and songtexte.com) to quantify the number of songs about the ten german cities listed in the table above.
I will search for songs with the city's name either in the song title or in the lyrics.  
Furthermore, I will search for songs including the official city name and synonyms (for example: Köln, Kölle, Colonia, Domstadt, ...).  
At this point, it will be vital that I also include synonyms of other cities and I have to be careful to not bias myself because I know more synonyms for "Köln" than for "Stuttgart".
